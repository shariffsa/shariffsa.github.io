**About:** I am a _**Data Analytics Supervisor**_ at the _**Central Bank of Malaysia**_, specializing in supervisory technology (SupTech) tools (e.g, geospatial analysis, entity outlier detection, financial forensics, and object detection). My work include applying these technologies in domains like _Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorism Financing and Proliferation Financing, Payment Fraud, Risk Assessment, and Policymaking_. In addition to my work at the Central Bank, I am also interested in researching the intersection of _Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Development Economics, AI Governance, Responsible AI, and AI's impact on the Labor Market_. I am _**open**_ to research opportunities in these fields!

**Currently:** I am on study leave from work, and currently enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University studying _Master's of Information Systems Management (specializing in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics)_, with an expected graduation date of August 2026.
